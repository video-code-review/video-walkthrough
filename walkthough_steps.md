# Walkthrough steps

As shown at the beginning of the video, you can select what you want to include in your video and in what order you want to cover them.
When recording as you jump to the next step you will automatically be taken to the exact page or section for that element (where possible).

You can include:

* The overview
* Commits page
* Each individual commit
* Review comments
* Review summaries
* Discussion comments
* Edited files
* Custom step (no automatic jumping)

Tags are added to each step so you can easily see what the step is for and who created it.
